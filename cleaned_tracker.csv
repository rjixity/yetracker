""I walk through the halls of the school and it’s cool
To be known by many for my rapping ability
But what about the brothers who ain't got it like me?
Making money off the trade, you could say I had it made
Drugs are on the rise and it's not a big surprise
You see no soul in a young brother's eyes
Trying to be hard by the streets but the streets kinda hard
But here's another factor we wanna disregard
Black-on-black is a stab in my back
It really hurts my soul when I hear about that""",Not Available,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwX0-UWsrW8

Thank God For Drugs,John Legend - Made to Love [V2],"Dave Tozer said that after hearing this early version, ""Kimbra got this idea to try a melody that she had…So she just got on the mic and started humming these melodies. And she did a bunch of that scatting because it was just really about capturing the melody idea she had. And so we got it down and we were like, 'that's cool' and then later as I worked through it…The initial idea was that if we were to use that, we'd probably write some lyrics to it and develop it further. But as I was editing the song and working through it…I just really liked it the way it was…She just sounds so cool. And I started sort of putting it in certain spots and shaping it up so that it was like a reoccurring part, a hook. And then we had this sort of breakdown part, where she's sort of scatting, almost like a solo. And so I just said to John, 'Let's use it like this. I think it's great!'""",Not Available,https://thesource.com/2013/10/07/sourcetv-exclusive-interview-with-john-legends-love-in-the-future-executive-producer-dave-tozer/

""I promise this
Ima protect em like obama kids
Damn I'm my mama kid
Cause that's exactly what my mama did
She kept all her promises
That's not what the problem is
Open air on air
Wondering if anyone cares out there
Wondering if anyone cares out there
I use the world as my therapist
Rapping bout my problems
Yeah the struggle makes for good songs
But can anyone solve em
I know my pain was put on me to entertain
Ideas get exchanged
And I get a little change
And I bought a little chain
With or with out the fame
I felt literally the same
How somebody gonna tell you you should be ashamed
All the talk about bit coins a bit annoying
Some people only hang around when I'm employing
I have the craziest oh I don't say crazy I demented. But I'm just being lazy
I threw Vanessa Beecroft sculpture in the crinib
I needed for negative space for it
More negative controversy
Not gone lie that what pays for it
Ima always say something wrong
You just gotta wait for it
And that your moment to kill me and spread hate
Till the moment I was in UCLA for it
I really thought I was made for it
Thought I could take anything
These things break our whole tradition
Wether is bling bling or car loads of bitches
Our flows is different. Narcos to Simpson
Niggas want me to make my imojis blacker I as what's blacker than a Simpson
See that's my roll men
I was always trollin
Wore a bear head just to piss my label mates off
I always didn't fit in then started to do it on purpose
Was I really different or being on surface
Was rapping really method acting connected to a bigger purpose
I seem to destroy everything I built on the pursuit of perfect
Happiness is excepting everything won't be perfect
And the worst parts of this movie called gone be worth it""",Not Available,

God's Country,Future Bounce [V12],"Victory wrote the verse that Travis Scott later recorded over. Likely written/recorded in May 2020. The original lyrics are as follows:

""I can see the future it's looking like we leveled through the sky,
I can't wait to live in Glory of eternal Paradise
Won't you take my will
I'm ready to surrender my whole life
Might as well turn up now
He gon' pop up unnanounced
Hear the trumpets
Do you like the way it sounds?""
