He also rapped the verse during an interview with Chris Campion. It's unknown if Kanye ever recorded the verse on an actual track. There are more lyrics to the verse according to Kanye, but he forgot them.

""I walk through the halls of the school and it’s cool
To be known by many for my rapping ability
But what about the brothers who ain't got it like me?
Making money off the trade, you could say I had it made
Drugs are on the rise and it's not a big surprise
You see no soul in a young brother's eyes
Trying to be hard by the streets but the streets kinda hard
But here's another factor we wanna disregard
Black-on-black is a stab in my back
It really hurts my soul when I hear about that""",,,,Confirmed,Not Available,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwX0-UWsrW8

2012 version, likely from July, intended for the September 2012 release of Travis Scott's Owl Pharaoh album. Cut during delays and reworks of the album, but eventually ended up on Kid Cudi's Satellite Flight: The Journey to Mother Moon album as a solo Kid Cudi song. Confirmed by Travis to be a ""Travis Scott Kanye Killhoffer production"". Claimed by Pharaohxx to be an early version of ""Shit On You"", but may also contain elements of ""Bad Mood"" which heavily features the word ""Fuck"" and was eventually incorporated into ""Shit On You"" as a single song on Owl Pharaoh. Travis and Anthony Kilhoffer produced ""Shit On You"", so it's likely this version uses that instrumental rather than the later version featuring the Daft Punk and Michael Jackson samples.",,Jul 2012,,Confirmed,Not Available,https://pillows.su/f/db4272df52ea9c967f170c8dff8c02c7

""I promise this
Ima protect em like obama kids
Damn I'm my mama kid
Cause that's exactly what my mama did

That's not what the problem is
Open air on air
Wondering if anyone cares out there
Wondering if anyone cares out there
I use the world as my therapist
Rapping bout my problems
Yeah the struggle makes for good songs
But can anyone solve em
I know my pain was put on me to entertain
Ideas get exchanged
And I get a little change
And I bought a little chain
With or with out the fame
I felt literally the same
How somebody gonna tell you you should be ashamed
All the talk about bit coins a bit annoying
Some people only hang around when I'm employing
I have the craziest oh I don't say crazy I demented. But I'm just being lazy
I threw Vanessa Beecroft sculpture in the crinib
I needed for negative space for it
More negative controversy
Not gone lie that what pays for it
Ima always say something wrong
You just gotta wait for it
And that your moment to kill me and spread hate
Till the moment I was in UCLA for it
I really thought I was made for it
Thought I could take anything
These things break our whole tradition
Wether is bling bling or car loads of bitches
Our flows is different. Narcos to Simpson
Niggas want me to make my imojis blacker I as what's blacker than a Simpson
See that's my roll men
I was always trollin
Wore a bear head just to piss my label mates off
I always didn't fit in then started to do it on purpose
Was I really different or being on surface
Was rapping really method acting connected to a bigger purpose
I seem to destroy everything I built on the pursuit of perfect
Happiness is excepting everything won't be perfect

Shortly after the announcement of the delay, Kanye underwent a sudden and dramatic conversion towards born-again evangelical Christianity, debuting the Sunday Service Choir at the start of 2019. The creation of the choir coincided with the songs on Yandhi taking a new Christian lyrical focus. Eventually, the album would morph into the thoroughly Christian JESUS IS KING by mid-2019.",,,

Tracker Guidelines,,Editor Comments,,Misc. Notes,,,,
"Remember to use the right formatting. If you feel like something is missing or you did something wrong, copy something a previous submission has already done and use that as the guideline or just ask someone.",,"Currently, the best sites for uploading files are:
Pillowcase (or imgur gg if filetype is unsupported) for audio, & ImgBB for pictures.",,"The universal tracker timezone is ""EST"". If something leaks, make sure to look at the EST timezone to get the date right.",,,,
"No fan remakes, no unofficial mixtapes, nothing that's commercially available, always upload to a site that can be streamed off of.",,"cobalt.tools is really good for downloading any type of video (YouTube, TikTok, Vimeo etc). Make sure to go to the settings and change ""audio bitrate"" to be 320kbps.",,"All dates are to be written in ""Month Day, Year"" format as opposed to the ""Month/Day/Year or Day/Month/Year"" format. It SHOULD be Day/Month/Year, but this is how the previous tracker editors did it, and it'd be a hassle to change it back.",,,,
"Make sure you use alternating colors and check often that they are not broken (Format, Alternating Colors, choose white and the grey that has one grey in between it and white.)",,"When linking to sources like web interviews, highlight over what is relevant with your mouse and then right click ""Copy link to highlight"". Doing so jumps straight to the part you highlighted and makes it stand out, which helps a ton.",,"If you change the color/name of an era even slightly, make sure to apply the changes in every other page of the Tracker (Released, Stems, Album Copies & Misc). Same with adding/removing eras.",,,,
"No released remixes, no matter how obscure, should be on this page. Those should be in Misc / Released.",,"For sources with YouTube videos, go to the timestamp you need and right click ""Copy Video URL at current time"" instead of just copying the video. Use if it's stuff that needs it (e.g. long interviews).",,"When adding sample info to an entry, make sure it's the earliest version with the sample that it's mentioned on or for certain entries it should be the Best Of / Special version.",,,,
"All music video editions, live freestyles, and released remixes go in Misc / Released.",,,,"""Avaliable Length"" matters more than ""Quality"", if there is a LQ partial snippet and a lossless snippet, the LQ partial takes presidence as it's longer.",,,,
"Era names are chosen by what name represents the era. (ex. LOVE EVERYONE represents it's era better than Hitler, despite it being considered as the era's name for a longer period.) 
To decide what name should represent an era, concider how often the name was used compared to other ones, how long it was used, what the community refers to the era as, and what's the most known/least obscure name of that era.",,"note: the official cobalt instance is broken with youtube, if you need to download from youtube use a community instance like cobalt.meowing.de.",,"""Rumored | Not Avaliable"" always have N/A if they don't have a link, ""Conficting Sources | Not Avaliable"" and Confirmed | Not Avaliable"" do not.",,,,
"The order of a song's artist contributions should go like this:
(with: ) -> (ref. ) -> (feat. ) -> (anything else) -> (prod. ) 
",,PLEASE don't upload with pixeldrain. Pixeldrain deletes files from free users after 100 days and is not compatible with artistgrid.,,"Do not write the name of the song in the notes column. Note down sample names and other songs if they need to be crossreferenced, but not the actual song name of the song in notes.",,,,
,,,,Please don't use the restore function if there's new info unless its extremely necessary.,,,,
